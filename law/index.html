                    <p>Litigation is the process of going to court to argue your case. The case could be criminal, in which the state argues that a citizen violated the law, or civil, in which two citizens or businesses argue against each other. Within each of these categories there are several other smaller courts.</p>
                    <p>Although exact procedures vary by court and by state, most trials follow a similar pattern. One side, known as the "plaintiff," "complainant," or "prosecution," files a complaint listing out all of ways the other party broke the law. The other party responds by admitting or denying the items in the complaint.</p>
                    <p>There is an investigative period known as discovery, in which both parties investigate the facts of the case. The parties will attempt to resolve their issues many times over these initial stages, but if these attempts are unsuccessful, the case will go to trial.</p>

                <p class="pb_font-14">Retaliation by an employer against an employee who either (1) complains about discrimination, (2) partcipates in an investigation or (3) opposes discrimination practices is illegal and can provide the retaliated-against employee a basis to sue. At T.J. Piotrowski, we encourage you to contact us immediately if you are currently experiencing retaliation so that we can counsel you regarding the best method for documenting your situation and protecting your legal rights. </p>

                <p class="pb_font-14">The New York minimum hourly wage is $11.10 an hour. Under the New York law, this is generally the lowest wage employers are allowed to pay their employees. Unfortunately, some employers do not follow this law and pay their New York employees much less than they are owed. At T.J. Piotrowski, we represent workers who were not paid the wages they earned.</p>

                <p class="pb_font-14"> With some exceptions, if you have worked over 40 hours in any given week, your employer should have paid you your regular rate of pay for the first 40 hours and 1.5 times your regular rate of pay for each hour after 40. We help employees who may have been illegally denied their right to fair compensation. If you have not been paid the fair wages to which you were entitled, you can recover the wages you should have been paid plus what is called liquidated damages, which are typically an additional amount equal to the wages you were owed. The law also allows you to recover the costs of your lawsuit and your attorney's fees so the case does not cost you anything because your employer has to pay all of the fees and costs.</p>

At T.J. Piotrowski Law Firm we handle a very wide variety of personal injury cases and are committed to helping you achieve the best possible results. With their depth of trial and negotiating skills, attorneys will work hard to help you receive the justice you deserve. Insurance companies count on the fact that some lawyers lack significant trial skills and can be intimidated by having to prove their client's case to a jury. With T.J. Piotrowski by your side, the insurance company won't dare to make that assumption.</p>

Thomas Piotrowski represented me in a very difficult case against the Department of Labor. Other attorneys that I consulted prior to retaining him were not interested in my case feeling that these type of cases were too complicated, costly and time consuming. Thankfully, someone told me about Thomas. I was skeptical & prejudged him upon our first meeting, thinking that he is too young & possibly too inexperienced. I could not have been more wrong and frankly speaking Thomas exceeded my expectations by far. He developed a realistic, successful plan that concluded with justice in my favor.&rdquo;</p>
